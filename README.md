# A First Example on Genetic Algorithms
This is my first experiment with genetic algorithms. The following tries to efficiently brute-force an unknown string (while knowing it) which isn't amazing, but you can imagine next versions would involved trying to guess the pre-images of values subjected to some map, efficiently instead of brute-force when the only other known solution would be brute-force guessing.

## Running the program

To run the program on a UNIX system (Linux, MacOS, etc.):
open terminal, navigate to the current folder, enter the following:
```
make
./t.out
```

If a "not executable" error shows up, try the following:
```
chmod +x ./t.out
./t.out
```

That should work.
